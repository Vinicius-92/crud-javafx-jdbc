# Department and Seller CRUD
## (Create, Retrieve, Update and Delete)

A sample application that demonstrate a basic control of a database of sellers and departments. Made using:

  * Java
  * JavaFX
  * MySQL
  * SOLID principles
  
## What I've learned:
  
  While structuring this basic application I was able to understand better how SOLID principles work and why to apply them to the project,
  reusing part of the code from another project and not having to re-do the entire connection with database.
  
## Interface:
